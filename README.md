# QuickLink Plugin

This plugin will let you create quick links inside your notes and rename them very quickly without using annoying "|" character.
The plugin is developed as part of my university course, in which I should contribute to some open-source project.

## Why?
Creating hyperlink with anchor text in Obsidian can be pain. This plugin solves the problem, so that you can create hyperlinks fast enough just by pressing hotkey. 

## How does it work?
Imagine you have an article called "Sun" and you want to reference it using an anchor name "Sunny". If *_* is your delimiter(can be changed in plugin settings), write down *Sun_Sunny* and call the plugin from the command palette or using a hotkey. The hyperlink will be created. Quick and easy.

This plugin also works without delimiter and can be used as plain hyperlink creator.
