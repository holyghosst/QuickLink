# QuickLink Plugin

This plugin will let you create quick links inside your notes and rename them very quickly without using annoying "|" character.
The plugin is developed as part of my university course, in which I should contribute to some open-source project.

## Why?
Creating hyperlink with anchor text in Obsidian can be pain. This plugin solves the problem, so that you can create hyperlinks fast enough just by pressing hotkey. 

## How does it work?
Imagine you have an article called "Sun" and you want to reference it using an anchor name "Sunny". Just write down *Sun_Sunny* (if *_* is your delimiter) and press the hotkey that you can choose in the plugin settings. The hyperlink will be created. Quick and without pain.

This plugin also works without delimiter and can be used as plain hyperlink creator.
